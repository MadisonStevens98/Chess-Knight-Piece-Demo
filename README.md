# Chess-Knight-Piece-Demo
A C++ demo program. Takes an int for the row and column (both 1-8 only) from the user and places the knight piece (represented by the #9) on the board. The other numbers on the board are where the knight can currently move. The program then offers to exit(E), or loop again by typing the number of the spot you want to move the knight too.
